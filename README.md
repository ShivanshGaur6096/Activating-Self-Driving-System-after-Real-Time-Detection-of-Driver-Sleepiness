# Activating-Self-Driving-System-after-Real-Time-Detection-of-Driver-Sleepiness
I emphasis on development of this system for my major-project in my final year. This system is development-cum-learning project where I get familiar with various framework and libraries in Python programming. In this repositorie there are two individual system which further integrated into one system.
### System 1: Driver Sleepiness Detection System
In this system you are going to see the working of:
1. OpenCV (where CV stand for Computer Vision)
2. Dlib
3. imutils
4. Playsound (or you can use Pygame)
5. subprocess (compare between os.system and subprocess to call subprogram using parent program)

Note: If you want to run this system individually comment the while condition of subprocess.Popen

#### System 2: Self Driving Car
To work in this system you required few thing in your system
1. [Udacity Sefl-Driving-Sim](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)
2. Laptop/Desktop with good specs.
